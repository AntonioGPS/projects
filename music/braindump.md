[Music Hacker - S2E5 - vocals, samples, loops, and autotuning in LMMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSqorcfHgxc&t=845s).The vocoder with whitenoise input can be used to morph vocals for a harsh EBM sound.

Best practice: Each instrument/voice should be on its own effects channel, for easy mixing.

[Fl Studio Tutorial: EBM or Darkwave PT 1](https://youtu.be/iEJR2i9orDs?t=63).
Using a arpeggiator with a trance lead to get an interesting sound out of simple chord progressions.

[Music Hacker - S2E4 - Vocal effects and processing in Audacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQW358Ikh8s).
First normalize to near-max amplitude.
Leave a good amount of no-sound recording before and after the recording. Use this as the noise profile and remove using Denoise.
Use select and apply Amplitude effect to bring up lower volume utterances. Then trim exactly to just the vocal parts.
Also showing how to creating more interesting, or backing-like vocals sounds by duplicating the track,
and slightly offsetting the time some clicks, and changing the pitch by couple of semitones

Using a bit of shared effects on drums to make them more cohesive. Compressor+EQ.
Very nice easy synth created by a squarewave one octave down, then a saw at normal octave, with a mildly resonant lowpass.
Baseline basically just repeated 16ths on same note. Started with single note, then after creating some melody move it to follow a chord progression with some walking. 
Side-chaining the bassline by the drums to make it a bit clearer.
Really nice visualization tools in FL Studio on the Parametric Equalizer and Limiter,
where current sound is overlayed into.

[Sound like Deadmau5 with LMMS](https://youtu.be/zDjkhdUPJ74?t=641).

[Mixing in LMMS 1: Gain Staging ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kdbwnay8R8).
Set individual instruments/FX channels to a low base volume, then adjust their relative volumes with low volume.
Then can bring the volume up to desired level with the master level, or using a maximizer.

[Mixing in LMMS 2: Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDl7j-mKMHc).
Making the onset of percussion very clear with a compressor with a low threshold and very high ratio (basically a limiter), with an attack (ignoring) delay. So that first onset is not limited by the compressor, but rest is.

[Mixing in LMMS 3: Panning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2iWR-YOpjY).
Basic to 'widen' the sound: Pan one instrument slight to left, and another similar instrument to the right.

Close your eyes and 'touch the person singing on the nose'.

[ANGELSPIT Blipvert #1 : Writing Lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYDjNKESS5A).

Very standard: aaaa, abab.
abcb. 1,2,3 does not rhyhme, 4 rhymes with 2. "works best when rhyme goes for 4,8 or 16 bars"

[ANGELSPIT Blipvert #2 : Songwriting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmkz-wIlOG8)
"cant think of anything to go with your brilliant riff [chorus]? Take that riff and simplify it and call it a verse.
so that the verse and the chorus riff are basically the same, but one is more simplified. Example: "

[Angelspit BLIPVERT: Lyric Content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClWne9Xh_i8).
"don't write about the act, write about the mood surrounding the act"
"write about the feeling itself, but without saying 'I feel..'"
Kind-of a show,don't tell.
"Remember: the best writing partner already exists, within the audiences head.
If you describe the shadow of a monster, the audience will imagine something
probably more horrifying than you can ever describe"

"the verses are the questions. They are setting up the background story.
Chorus is like the punchline. Its the resolutions, answers, and twists
to all the confusion you express in the verses"
"start the chorus with a big Major chord. This will add power.
Especially if writing dark, angry music"

"chorus lyrics are the most important part of a song.
You need a *short, memorable hook*. I got two ultimate tests for a chorus:
1) say the chorus twice to a friend.
If they can remember it after two hours, then its good.
If they can remember it the next morning, then it is a hit"
2) imagine a pub..drunken people..singing around a piano. BADLY..
Can you imagine them singing your chorus? If no, simplify it.

[Terror EBM lead tutorial - "The Terror Swap"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnWASjepnM8).
Synth lead starts with has notes on the downbeat, then swapping to be on the offbeat.
Changing roughly every 1 measure. Ending the section on the downbeat normally.
Can fill in the 'gaps' by adding notes at the root.
These notes can be moved to follow along the chord progression (or be contra).

Also taking super basic pattern of 4 notes. Duplicating and then trying to offset 
at different locations to 'find' interesting rhythms.

[Creating Audio Textures that Groove Tutorial - Breath & Decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3S3k4c4dHI).
Taking a short speech sample (6). Then using distortion and a heavy multi-delay to make it a bit more musical.
Bringing it down an octave or two too make it less speech and more abstract.
Also using swaps of effect presets for each measure to add some more motion in the sound.

[How to get harsh EBM or Industrial Vocals in FL Studio (or any DAW, really)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlM3P5SE1g).
Pitch Shifter - Distortion - Delay - Reverb.
Pitch shifting by multiple. -1 semitone, -2 semitone, -3.
The VST used can do it itself, might need multiple and mix it with other VSTs.
Rest is pretty standard.

[How to aggrotech industrial snare drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmjCSF4zXuY).
Use a snare sample which is a bit distorted from the start.

Align with original sample and mix in only the buildup (reversed reverb).

[How To: Create a Chorus Effect in Audacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xSKxEeT19M).
Record the sample track once more. No need to make purposeful changes, as any recording will be slighty different, which already helps.
Duplicate the second sample. Then slighty timeshift once clip forward, the other by same amount backwards. Pan the secondary clips to left/right. 

[Audacity Tutorial: Cool Spooky/Ghostly Voice Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLkXFepSwU0).
Ghostly/demonic effect. Like in fantasy/scifi game characters.

[Glitch Effect Audacity Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKNDp3PfPkk).
Selecting small sections of vocals (typically vowels, but not critical) then repeat it by 2-3 times. Do it a bunch of places.
Can also apply to such small sections downpitching by a huge amount (50). Also duplicate track, pitchshift up a bunch and mix in.
Also glitching music by importing some piano/strings combo, downpitching by ~12 percent and reversing.

[How to Make Creepy Horror Music in Audacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_c2Awf-S1s). Gives a dark ambient .

[HOW TO AMBIENT DRONE MUSIC IN AUDACITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX2h1nJEeZY).
Super sarcastic tutorial to create ambient drone, but result is pretty interesting startingpoint.
Import Raw a executable file (or similar non-audio data).
Remove the white noise (by filtering)?
Then stretch the audio out a bunch. Then reverb, delay. Only at the end normalize the audio level.

[How to make a heart beat effect in Audacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ4IpQBCVmo). Sounds pretty good.
Generating two sine chirps, starting at 1xx Hz ending at 1Hz. Second one with slightly higher frequency,

[Growing Music: musical interpretations of L-Systems](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8c2f/caaf3153779ec3e838b416cd6e6d7feecdb9.pdf).
Uses Lindenmayer systems to create compositions with a formal grammar rooted in musical theory.
The stocastic subdivision approach looks promising.

[Score generation with L−systems (1968)](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/score.icmc86.pdf).
Uses a Hilbert curve to map the traditional graphical Lindenmayer systems onto a timeline.
Seems a bit roundabout way of generating a composition, but the co-creation of graphics and sound may be of interest.
Although for music visualization, maybe better to create a graphical representation by mapping audio-rules of a composition
to a graphical action/effect.

[Musical L-systems (128 pages)](http://carlosreynoso.com.ar/archivos/manousakis.pdf).
Comprehensive, with a methodological approach with lots of explanations. 

[Space Ambient Part 1: Mega Pads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MafvNBjqcGI).
Really nice sounds using Reaktor Migraine (granular synthesis?).
Also using samples of various kinds stretched with PaulStretch into Absynth.
Have to make sure its constant pitch during the sample.
Stereo samples gets good width automatically when stretched.
Long linear-rampup for envelope attack and release.
Using many voice polyphony to handle simultanious notes.
Using 'etherizer' effect, which does granualar re-synthesis.
Layering sounds by adding in a second sample to another OSC. Using envelopes to mix them
Can match the pitch, either same note or a harmonic relative (like a 5th).
If using 'rawer' sound, could be good base for something like Book of Eli OST? 

[Electronic Music Theory: 3/4, 6/8 and Triplets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OPhnvaDT58)
3/4 is waltz time. When people say 3-time in electronic music however, and what is more common, is 6/8. 
"Even though based in 3 - it has a 2 feeling, since can have accent is falling on 4th"
Sometimes people mean triplets, which is just 3 notes in span of 4th note, with meter still at 4/4.
Tempo does not change, and is not a total

[Music Theory for Electronic Musicians: The Unified Theory of Basslines Pt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVV3_f5QZBw).
Using the kick drum as basis for the bassline. Copy/pasting over. Basic is just following the kick pattern, and chord progression.
Then can start to move some notes to be part of the chord progression triad chords, add passing notes etc.
Can also invert to always avoid the kick, 

[Ableton Live Operator Tutorial: Techno Fundamentals - More Than A Bassline w/ John Selway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZVM9sxBZOI).
Using FM synthesis to create interesting bassline.
Have a sine C0-C1 subbass with glissando and a bit of swing, then adding another wave with percussive envelope to bring mids.
Can play around with modulate envelop and level of the second waveform to tweak the effect.
End sound shown could sound killer if made more harsh/agressive. 

[Ableton Live Tutorial: Techno Fundamentals Pt 3 - One Note To Rule Them All - Effects + Automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oPrWo-fB28)
From 14:30 is the interesting part, when actually playing with it. Using a single note, with a lot of modulation parameter on the synth,
then experimenting with these parameters live to get ideas for building/deconstructing music.
Sidechained chorus, envelope times, filter frequncies.

Also: Abelton Reverb module has nice early reflection 'spin' which changes frequencies a bit.
And filters for the diffusion network, which allows to tune how. Can have long/huge chorus without bass booming taking over. 

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5hYS05kkLc).
Playing complete random things on keyboard, then 1/16th quantize starts, make it monophonic,
and then using looped selection to find interesting sections.  

[How I Produce A Groove Where Every Sound Talks To Eachother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n6FAo_T878)
Using time, reverbs/pan to create call-answer ping-pong.
Then using this as composition technique, adding percussion samples successively that keep the conversation going.

# Lyrics

## Ideas

Fame is a #falseauthority
Celebrity
Kind-of a pyramid scheme.
To become famous, support people who already are famous (making them famous)
Narrow unrepresentative selection from groups (ex: 'actors') distorts peoples beliefs.
"actors earn a lot of money".
People seeking fame willing to work for not-so-much-money,
believing it will come in the future.
Exploited/abused
Lottery.

Cult of personality
'famous for being famous'
'15 minutes of fame' Warhol/Finkenstein
Banksy: 'In the future everyone will be anonymous for fifteen minutes'




Selling shovels at the goldrush
Becoming rich by supplying neccesities (real or preceived) to
people seeking to become rich (often by longshots)
Playing people to follow their folly,
so one can harvest the tangible wins
House always wins
People looking for quick fixes, easy answers


The Fear Itself (ref R.Franklin)
Fear of the unknown, all in our head
Monsters under the bed
'the thing' that is feared grow strongers for as long as its not challenged
even if there is nothing at all *the fear itself* can have real effects
Freeze, fight or flight
 
Panic attacks 'the fear of fear itself'

## Quotes

"We don't know who struck first, us or them, but we know that it was us that scorched the sky."
[1.](http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Dark_Storm)
Morpheous, The Matrix

```
Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something.
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.
You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world.
You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.
It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?
(The Matrix)
...
(The Matrix) is everywhere
...
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. 
...
(That) you are a slave, Neo.
Like everyone else you were born into bondage.
Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch.
A prison for your mind.
```
