Very nice easy synth created by a squarewave one octave down, then a saw at normal octave, with a mildly resonant lowpass.
Baseline basically just repeated 16ths on same note. Started with single note, then after creating some melody move it to follow a chord progression with some walking. 
Side-chaining the bassline by the drums to make it a bit clearer.
Really nice visualization tools in FL Studio on the Parametric Equalizer and Limiter,
where current sound is overlayed into.

[ANGELSPIT Blipvert #2 : Songwriting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmkz-wIlOG8)
"cant think of anything to go with your brilliant riff [chorus]? Take that riff and simplify it and call it a verse.
so that the verse and the chorus riff are basically the same, but one is more simplified. Example: "

[Angelspit BLIPVERT: Lyric Content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClWne9Xh_i8).
"don't write about the act, write about the mood surrounding the act"
"write about the feeling itself, but without saying 'I feel..'"
Kind-of a show,don't tell.
"Remember: the best writing partner already exists, within the audiences head.
If you describe the shadow of a monster, the audience will imagine something
probably more horrifying than you can ever describe"

"the verses are the questions. They are setting up the background story.
Chorus is like the punchline. Its the resolutions, answers, and twists
to all the confusion you express in the verses"
"start the chorus with a big Major chord. This will add power.
Especially if writing dark, angry music"

"chorus lyrics are the most important part of a song.
You need a *short, memorable hook*. I got two ultimate tests for a chorus:
1) say the chorus twice to a friend.
If they can remember it after two hours, then its good.
If they can remember it the next morning, then it is a hit"
2) imagine a pub..drunken people..singing around a piano. BADLY..
Can you imagine them singing your chorus? If no, simplify it.

Using percussion samples, stretching and tuning them down to form bassline.
Using environmental sounds, like waves of water, cars passing to place the listener somewhere else. 


[Serum Tutorial - Ambient Drone Pro Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtgMa3nDJD8).

[Growing Music: musical interpretations of L-Systems](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8c2f/caaf3153779ec3e838b416cd6e6d7feecdb9.pdf).
Uses Lindenmayer systems to create compositions with a formal grammar rooted in musical theory.
The stocastic subdivision approach looks promising.

[Score generation with L−systems (1968)](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/score.icmc86.pdf).
Uses a Hilbert curve to map the traditional graphical Lindenmayer systems onto a timeline.
Seems a bit roundabout way of generating a composition, but the co-creation of graphics and sound may be of interest.
Although for music visualization, maybe better to create a graphical representation by mapping audio-rules of a composition
to a graphical action/effect.

[Musical L-systems (128 pages)](http://carlosreynoso.com.ar/archivos/manousakis.pdf).
Comprehensive, with a methodological approach with lots of explanations. 

[Space Ambient Part 1: Mega Pads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MafvNBjqcGI).
Really nice sounds using Reaktor Migraine (granular synthesis?).
Also using samples of various kinds stretched with PaulStretch into Absynth.
Have to make sure its constant pitch during the sample.
Stereo samples gets good width automatically when stretched.
Long linear-rampup for envelope attack and release.
Using many voice polyphony to handle simultanious notes.
Using 'etherizer' effect, which does granualar re-synthesis.
Layering sounds by adding in a second sample to another OSC. Using envelopes to mix them
Can match the pitch, either same note or a harmonic relative (like a 5th).
If using 'rawer' sound, could be good base for something like Book of Eli OST?

# Lyrics

## Ideas

Fame is a #falseauthority
Celebrity
Kind-of a pyramid scheme.
To become famous, support people who already are famous (making them famous)
Narrow unrepresentative selection from groups (ex: 'actors') distorts peoples beliefs.
"actors earn a lot of money".
People seeking fame willing to work for not-so-much-money,
believing it will come in the future.
Exploited/abused
Lottery.

Cult of personality
'famous for being famous'
'15 minutes of fame' Warhol/Finkenstein
Banksy: 'In the future everyone will be anonymous for fifteen minutes'




Selling shovels at the goldrush
Becoming rich by supplying neccesities (real or preceived) to
people seeking to become rich (often by longshots)
Playing people

## Themes
Manipulation of people
Psychology, the mind. Perception
'how we see the world'

Human experience. Finding the core
'things that stay the same'

## Quotes

"We don't know who struck first, us or them, but we know that it was us that scorched the sky."

Morpheous, The Matrix

```
Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something.
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.
You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world.
You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.
It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?
(The Matrix)
...
(The Matrix) is everywhere
...
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. 
...
(That) you are a slave, Neo.
Like everyone else you were born into bondage.
Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch.
A prison for your mind.
