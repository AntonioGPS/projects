# Resin-based

Etsy.com. [Lots](https://www.etsy.com/no-en/search?q=epoxy+jewelry&explicit=1&page=3) of amazing looking products. Mostly rings,pendants.
Pure resin or resin+wood. 200-400 NOK. Sometimes glow-in-the-dark.
Resin 'stone' with wood base, silver ring inlay. 700-800 NOK.

Maybe silver + resin cast rings has good opportunity? Not found, might be able to push price up.

# Silver-based

Oxididation. Electroetching with laser-engraved masks?
