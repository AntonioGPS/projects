# 3d-printable brushless DC motor

Inspired by [3d-printed DC motor by pitrack]
(http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-DC-Motor/step4/Mechanical-Design/)

Overall this design is less printable (more vitamins),
but is hopefully practical and powerful enough to be useful in realistic scenarios.

![Model](./doc/outrunner-rev0.png)
![PCB](./doc/pcb-rev0.png)

## Notable changes

* Integrated driver electronics. Standard components, designed for reuse.
* Outrunner design instead of inrunner
* Using iron-core (M4 bolts) electromagnets instead of air
* Has a bearing (608) and a metal axel (M8)
* 6 teeh stator, 8-10 pole rotor instead of 3/4
* Smaller distance between rotor and stator magnets

Important features retained

* 3d-printable w/common vitamins
* Winding of electromagnets done separately, facilicated by winding tool

Drawbacks

* More vitamins required
* Magnets have to be glued to rotor


## Usecases

* PC/cooling fan. Radial or axial. 80/120 mm.
* Peristaltic pump (fluids). Might need gearing
* Impeller pump (fluids), for instance for hydroponics.
* Camera jig, using belt/wires to translate to linear motion
* Electromagnet winding tool, so it can help replicate itself!
* Extruder/print cooling fan. Requires minimization
* Spindle motor for CNC. For instance by letting motor wrap around a ER chuck+shank.

The choice of lamination thickness depends on a balance between performance and cost.

## Firmware

Existing open source firmware.
Used in multi-copter etc, compatible with many many ESC packages.
Many using AVR atmega8/16 uCs.
These typically take servo-style 1ms -> 2ms pulse widths to mean 0% -> 100%.
Though on some high performance setups, the maximum pulsewidth is sometimes set to 125 us instead.

## Conventional manufacturing

Typically made by
* CNC machining or casting metal body
* Punched rotor laminates, assembled into stacks
* Stator coils are automatically wound

Low heat-dissipation of plastic a challenge, may need to go open-body.
Rotor is usually magneticed in-place.

Would be good to have an integrated driver, on the motor, which could be controlled smartly from a central unit.

## Etching steel

Tin-can materials are magnetic (3/3 tested). A thickness of 0.3 mm (approx 0.012") seems to be common.
The material is some form of low-carbon steel.

Steel can be etched using a electrolyte and electrical current.
Here is one [etching steel with vinegar, salt and 12v battery charged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhWNmNYT-Q4).
Another electro etch [using a metallic electrolyte](http://www.nontoxicprint.com/electroetching.htm).

Creating an etch mask can be done with the laser, like with PCB production:
[1](http://www.instructables.com/id/PCB-plastic-mask-etching-with-CO2-laser/)
[2](http://www.instructables.com/id/Custom-PCB-Prototyping-using-a-Laser-Cutter)

Some [safety considerations using NaCL-based etching](http://www.es.crujera.com/publicaciones/articulos/the-basis-of-electro-etchin/appendix-b---practical.html).

Using a 15ish percent vinegar solution (diluted from 35% percent with hot tapwater)
with approx 1 table spoons salt per 1 dl. Current was around 0.60 - 0.70 amps,
driven by a 12v power supply.

Was able to etch through the 0.3 mm 'tin can' in less than 30 minutes.
The mask was open on each side, so to get through etch is only 0.15 mm deep.
This requires precise registration of two-sided mask.
The fast etch time, suggest that maybe doing a one-sided etch is possible as well.

Without a permantent magnet one can only build a [reluctance motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reluctance_motor) with this steel,
like a stepper based on [switched reluctance motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_reluctance_motor).
By adding a circular, axially oriented magnet in the center, one can build a
[hybrid stepper motor](http://www.nmbtc.com/step-motors/engineering/construction-and-operating-theory/),
like the typical NEMA17 used in 3d-printers. Excellent [video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Qc8zcst2blU#t=1823)

![First attempt at etching stepper motor parts](./doc/etch-first-stepper-parts.jpg)
Caliper is set to NEMA17 size (1.7" / 42 mm), for reference.

Removing resist with laser worked pretty well, but the acrylic spray-pain partly dissolved in the electrolyte - causing uneven etch.
Another problem is that material which have been etched sticks in the gaps, making it seem as if it has not etched through when it has
(possibly also interfering with etching action).
A pump/nozzle which would 'shoot' the electrolyte at the plate with a bit of force would likely improve that.

Would need to find a better spray (laquer is mentioned online), or use a tape.
Maybe regular scotch packaging tape,or wide PET/Kapton as used in 3d-printing.
Etching time was approx 30 minutes, from one side, with 1.5 amp current in 10% vinegar solution.

A flipping-jig would be needed to do two-sided masks (and etch).
A challenge in using recycled can material is that it is not flat, causing focus problems on laser.
A hydraulic piston with solid steel top and bottom plates, could possibly be used to squeeze material flat.

### Mask making

Using plastic tape selectively removed by laser-cutter to create masks was partially successful.
The tricky thing is finding settings/materials where the tape *and* its glue gets removed cleanly,
without causing too much removal (widens etchline) or bubbling of the plastic on edges.

Actually heat-resistant PET plastic, sometimes used as replacement for Kapton on 3d-printers,
appears to cut very nicely. However 2 passes seems to be way to go, one to deconstruct the plastic, and one to clean up.
Used 20%, 0.1mm linewidth, 200 mm/s on Redsail 60w.

Other techniques which may be worth trying instead for selective-laser removal is:

* Coating with paraffin/stearine, for instance from melted candles
* Coating with spay/fluid wax used for polishing (usually carnauba-wax). [Example](http://www.clasohlson.com/no/Hurtigvoks-/34-917)
* Coating with a varnish. Examples: [1](http://www.clasohlson.com/no/Original-Ferniss/34-1316)
[2](http://www.clasohlson.com/no/Winsor-&amp;-Newton-blank-maleferniss/34-4612)
[3](http://www.clasohlson.com/no/Liquitex-medium-og-ferniss/34-4085)

In [etching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etching), the material laid down to protect against the etchant is called the *ground*.
This page has many [modern alternatives for ground](http://www.nontoxicprint.com/hardandsoftground.htm),
including a type of commonly found acrylic wood finishing.

# Servomechanisms

The closed-loop nature of [servomechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servomechanism)
can be beneficial to locally fabricated machines, because it can be used to compansate for or correct errors.
This could allow to use cheaper/simple production methods and materials.
Also, it can allow machines to run closer to their theoretical limits - because there is
a way to detect & correct errors. Current generation Repraps 3d-printers will just continue running obliviously
after missing step(s), often leading to broken models.
Robotic arms with many degrees of freedom typically also rely on servos/feedback in order to accurately position their limbs.

Two types of systems are interesting:

1) Servo/feedback mechansism in motor. Either stepper motors, or 'servos' based on geared brushless DC motors
Typically [rotary encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder) are used for this.
2) Servo/feedback mechanism in larger machine, like the position of a 3d-printer head along an axis.
Typically [linear encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_encoder).

And, it is interesting to figure out:

1) How to integrate cheap, off-the-shelf encoders to form a closed loop system.
2) How to fabricate encoders using typical fablab equipment.
Using lasercutter to make optical systems, or using PCB etching for conductive both seems promising avenues.

Probably it makes sense to start with a usecase which does not require sub-millimeter precision.

# Linear motors

Most [Linear motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motor) are like rotary motors, just unfolded.
Therefor the common variations exist, including linear stepper motors, linear brushless, linear permanent magnet.

## Linear stepper motor

Linear stepper motor. Simplest example is [Sawyer](http://machinedesign.com/linear-motion/linear-motors-step-out),
a hybrid stepper (variable reluctance with single magnet).
Windings are on the moving part (called 'forcer), so cables have to be carried along.

The grid structure required for variable reluctance is easier to manufacture with a CNC when linear,
because it can be done from above as straight pockets.

## Brushless linear motor

The magnets are in the track, and windings in the moving forcer.
Typically a flat strip with forcer on top, or a U-profile with forcer inside.
Coupled with a linear encoder, can get a high-precision linear servo motor.
They are used for high-end pick&place, laser and water cutters.

## Voice coil actuator

Voice coil actuator or [Voice coil motor](http://www.moticont.com/voice-coil-motor.htm).
Short throw, up to couple inches. Designed for a set throw distance.

* [Instructable, voice coil, equations](http://www.instructables.com/id/Electromagnetic-Actuator/step4/Wind-bobbin/#step1)

## Tubular motor

Also called linear shaft motors.
Commercially available from Faulhaber, Moticon and LinMot.
Rod-magnets placed inside tube, each repelling eachother. `N/S<->S/N<->N/S<->S/N`
Either rod or circular casing can be stationary.

Could be good for moving the shuttle/rapier when doing weft insertion on a loom.
Could possibly be used for controlling the heddles.

If minimized and made cheap, potentially also individual heddle control, for Jaquis/digital loom.
Coupled with a linear encoder, could maybe be used for a shape display.

# Coil winding automation

Commercial systems

* [Youtube: BLDC coil winding machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrdzaA8CClk).
For an inrunner, whole cycle shown in real-time.
Does complex patterns by 'tieing off' the copper wire on a post outside the stator.
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d77b1C-ruw8). Another inrunner using same principle, doing 4-5 simultanously.

* [Youtube: rushless dc motor supplier auto winding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ws1P5hZBWo),
shows sliding geometry used on spinner to lay out wire back and forth on armature.
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcmNN4ZSLeo), also shows guiding mechanism working
relative to the armature geometry, and also the arm which spins the wire.

General principles

* Stator sits on a turntable/spike, which can rotate 360 degrees
* One armature is wound at a time, from start to finish
* Some winding configurations requires some windings go one way, and some the opposite
* The armature can be all wound with loose ends at each side,
then connected to form correct configuration afterwards.
* For small-ish motors, easier to autowind outrunners than inrunners.
This because the spinner can put windings onto stator from outside.
* Thinner gauge wire is preferred because it is easier to automatically wind
(number of windings will affect Kv number).
* For outrunners, a large wheel spins the incoming wire, guided into right place by some (motor size specific) geometry
* For inrunners, a 'finger' guides the wire around the , with a reprociating motion.
* This spinner wheel moves in and out on the armature to lay out the wire

Could possibly be used for 2-phase unipolar motors. But possibly better, would be to take that concept
and create H-bridge modules with current sensing/control. Such H-bridge could replace them entirely,
but also be used for stepper-motors and brushless DC-motors. Forming a generic, software-defined 'drive' system.
