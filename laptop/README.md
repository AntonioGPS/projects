### Circular cells

* 18650 batteries are 18.6mm standard. Capacity around 3000mAh.
Too thick to be underneath the screen and limits total thickness of screen part to 20mm.
1p*4s=4batteries @ 3000mAh = 44Wh. 2p=88Wh.
* 14500 are 14Ã—53mm (AA size). Capacity around 1000mAh.
3p*4s=12batteries @ 1000mAh = 44Wh. 4p=60Wh.

### LiPo 1s pack

LiPo flatpacks. 1 cell approx 7mm thick. Can stack 2 in height under screen.
6p*4s=24batteries @ 550mAH = 48Wh.
