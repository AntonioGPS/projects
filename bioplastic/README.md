Starch-based hydrolysis
-----------------------

During weekend of March 14-15, a series of simple starch-based plastics was created using hydrolysis.
Gelatine, corn-starch and agar was used as starch sources. Glyserol was used as the plasticizer.
The material was spread into thin sheets, 0.5 mm - 2 mm.
Both on its own, onto cotton fabric and mixed with wood filler.

[How to make starch bioplastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LskPNBvbuqM)

Take-aways

* Drying under a oven heater drastically improves drying time, down to 3-4 hours for ~1 mm.
* Fabric sheets will warp if only dried from one side and tend to curl up fabric.
* Drying on aluminum sheets seems to keep warping down
* When drying on platic/alu, the side that is down does not dry out (as water cannot escape)
* Maintaining even dimension impossible when spreading plastic out with spatula
* Pouring into a base mold, taking out to dry when solidified, yielded relatively consistent height
* Olive oil worked excellently as a mold release agent (with gelatine-based plastic)
* Recipies that use a lot of water (10-100 parts to 1 part starch) seem to primarily takes longer to cook/dry
Around 5 parts starch to water is enough for the hydrolysis. Breakdown of the amylose is unknown.
* **Sensitivity to water** is a problem. When the finished plastic is exposed to water, it dissolves

Conclusion

The plastic was very easy to create with low amounts of water, but the hydroscopic nature drastically
reduces possible applications.

Next steps

* Attempt a protein (casein) based plastic/rubber, denatured with tannic acid
* Attempt a propein (casein) based plastic, hardened with Ammonium Alum
* Attempt to mix casein plastic with starch-plastic , see if water insolubility is preserved
* Research polymerizing in another type of solution (methanol? alkali? etc)

## Shredder

Should automatically

* [Precious plastics shredder](https://preciousplastic.com/en/videos/build/shredder.html).
Mechanics designed to be built in mechanical workshop. Steel parts, for laser/plasma/watercutting.
Good teeth profile, has space for mesh in bottom for decicing particule size.
Could be improved for making in a fablab? M8 threaded rods instead of hexagonal, with 608 bearings.
Existing M10 rods should also become M8.
Knife pices are a mix of 5 and 6mm thickness, to provide clearance in cut.
Can it be made in wood (ply/HDF) instead of metal? Much faster to CNC.
Either using epoxy coating to harden surface, or 1mm steelplate along.
Could one use a more "standard" motor? Could NEMA23 with large gear be enough?

Challenges
-----------

# Hydrophilic

Most bioplastic interact with water, and properties vary due to it.
http://green-plastics.net/posts/70/qaa-can-i-make-waterproof-bioplastic/

One alternative is to apply a coating, that is bio-friendly and easy to produce locally.

* Bieswax
* Lanolin (sheep wool wax)
* Soy wax, from soy oil

# Tensile strength

Typically low for bioplastics.

Migitation ideas

* Strengthen using complex geometric micro/macro structures (3d print etc)
* Strengthen by adding fibers, from celloluse, hemp/jute etc

## Biocomposites

* Linen should have excellent properties, but fairly expensive.
* Nice [linen eating trays](http://www.shop-foglinen.com/products/linen-tray-natural)

# Protein-based plastic

[Galalith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galalith) was name of the commercial casein-based, formaldehyde-cured plastic popular just before WW2.
Used for button on textiles, details on furniture, and as an imitation of ivory.
It is a thermosetting plastic, so cannot be thermoformed, and not molded after having first set.
Its popularity faded due to lack of moldability, milk-shortage during war, and never recovered afterwards, due to availability of petroleum-based plastics.

By using sulfur, one can also make a kind-of [synthetic rubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_rubber). [How to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzEujd7iEHU).

## Possible uses

Hardplastic objects, as replacement to doing them out of acrylic/polyurethane.
Possibly especially interesting where wanting ivory or gemstone type imitation.

There was active research in 40ies around making textiles with it, but never seemed to get to product stage?
Some mentions of producs lanital, (Italy), and aralac (USA).

## Creation

Basic steps (some are in practice interlinked)

* Extract and purify protein
* Preticipate and polymerize the protein
* Extract all water
* Hardening
* Make shape
* After-curing

If already have pure casein, seem to need a strong base to make an alkali solution.
Rubber milk video uses Potassium Hydroxide (KOH).

One can of course add dyes and pigments.
Probably also use plasticiers and other additives to adjust material properties.
Can we add filler materials somehow? In which stage would it be done?

Protein preticipate, creation of solid material from a solution. For protein this action is often called [astringent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astringent).
[Tannins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin), some inorganic salts, among other things, have this effect.


## Making useful objects

Either one makes standard-sized blocks or sheets, then CNC mills into desired objects afterwards.
However this will lead to a lot of waste, and not bring many benefits over just buying plastics.
Instead one could, direct molding into usable object, or molding of customized stock.
This roughly shaped stock can then be CNC-milled afterwards.

May have speed and material efficiency benefits, when making several objects of the same 'class',
either as part of one production series, or because one often makes similar objects.
As an example, 3d-milled busts/portraits could benefit from a custom stock instead of being a block.
Making use of this advantage may require particular CNC toolpath generation, however.

The mold could be a two-sided mold of wood, which is then put in a press.
Holes will likely be needed to let water escape.

Or, lay material around a negative shape - then use vacum-bagging to pull it tight.
Will water escape into vacum pump?

### Injection molding

* [engineerguy: Plastic Injection Molding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMjtmsr3CqA). Very thorough and easy to understand.

### Melting down

Some melt plastic in oil. Especially plastic bags.

* [Instructable: Plastic Smithing](http://www.instructables.com/id/HomemadePlastic/). Plastic bags.
* [Youtube: HDPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlQJDgB3Iyc). Plastic bags.
* [Youtube: Melting plastic with oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfm8w0UzEX8). Melting plastic drinking straws

Nice advantage is that basically any energy source can be used. Transfer of heat should be much better than with air.
Could it make it possible to melt down plastic without shredding?
Can the molten blob injection molded or roller-extruded without extra heating sources?

### Extrusion

Can maybe make a general-purpose extrusion? Think Makeblock, 20x20 T-slot, circular tubes. Chamferrail?
Suitable for a continious process, possibly with addition of cut-to-length.
Could also produce circular 'shots' that would then be used for transfer/injection molding?
However requires that people have access to (make) molds to be actually useful.

Basic purification can be done by dissolving in alkali (for instance ammonia), stir it up with, then make acidic to precipitate again.
Better is to dissolve in methanol or ethanol. Will split out salts, break up acids and release water. Methanol can then be decantered or filtered off.
Then can use hot water and mashing it a round a bit, to encourage polymerization and release impurities. Change water and keep it hot.

### Production

Challenge: Reach molecular weight high enough to be useful for mechanical construction. Want around 100kDA
Challenge: Make production economically viable at low scales.
Challenge: Make production operatable by a small community, ie makerspace. 

Opportunities:

* Divesting from oil. Scarcity, rising prices, political interest, repurpose skills/equipment
* Biodegradable. 
* Circular economy, integrated recycling
* Vertical integration, designing for particular end-uses
* Biocompatibility. Medical uses


Production methods

* Direct/melt polycondensation. Lactic acid is condensated, typically with a metal-based catalyst and under vacuum.
* Solid-state polycondensation. Multi-step process:
1) Lactic acid is converted to a precursor, like the dimer lactide or oligio PLLA.
2) Polycondensation is performed on the precursor.
* Ring-opening polymerization. Lactic acid is converted to the lactide dimer and concentrated.
A second step with catalysts breaks open the rings of the dimer to form polymer chains. 
-Requires high purity precursors, catalysts.


Open questions:

* How can one dermine how much PLA vs lactide vs lactic acid result has?
* Can one determine molecular weights without expensive equipment?
Most important is to be able to compare results from different runs, to see
* How to test the mechanical properties?

Polycondensate with a molecular weight of 20,000 Da is first prepared by ordinary melt-polycondensation, crystallized by heat-treatment around 105°C, and heated at 140 or 150°C for 10–30 h for further polycondensation. A high-quality polymer of PLLA can be obtained in high yield in a relatively short reaction time and its molecular weight exceeds 500kDa.

### PLA adhesive

Could one use this for smoothening out 3d-prints? Immerse in a cooking bath of low-MW PLA?
Challenge is keeping at 200 deg C... And not melt too much of the part to be processed.

### TODO

Test making low-DA PLA/lactide

* Buy lactic acid from brewing store
* Use hotplate with mechanical stirrer, no vacuum, no catalyst.
* Test use as glue, for PLA parts and/or wood
* Test use as binder for wooddust, 3d-milling
* Test use as binder for textile composite, compression molding

Test making high-DA PLA

* Buy a vacuum pump
* Buy/borrow a vacuum chamber
* Get a catalyst. Stannous chloride?
* Test compression molding as mechanical part

Resource building

* Visit Eik ideverksted @ NMBU, ask about access to mechanical test equipment
* Visit NMBU chemistry lab, ask about access to chemical test equipment

using carbon dioxide as foaming agent. Densities down to 20–30 kg/m3. Using a physical foaming process, injected into polymer melt.
Then thermodynamic instability is induced by reducing the pressure and thus facilitating a phase transition starting with cell nucleation. Then third, after the nucleation there is cell growth.
At 105°C and 100 bar CO2 pressure, the solubility of CO2 in a PLA melt was approximately 100 g/kg.
Batch foaming includes a step of gas saturation at an elevated temperature followed by a cooling step prior to depressurization.
Typical pressure drop rates in batch foaming are of the order of 1 MPa/s whereas in extrusion foaming pressure drop rates of the order of 1-10 GPa/s are reported. The CO2 temperature in the range 12–14°C, CO2 pressure on injection was in the range 100–130 bar. Keeping the melt pressure at the die at 200 bar, for CO2 to be in supercritical state.

## Bacterial cellulose

Can synthesise/grow cellulosis using bacteria, consuming a carbon source like sucrose/glucose.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_cellulose

The most extensively studied species is Gluconacetobacter xylinus,
formerly known as Acetobacter xylinum and since reclassified as Komagataeibacter xylinus

Bacterial, or microbial, cellulose has different properties from plant cellulose and
is characterized by high purity, strength, moldability and increased water holding ability.

A. xylinum is the model microorganism for basic and applied studies on cellulose due to its ability
to produce relatively high levels of polymer from a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources.
