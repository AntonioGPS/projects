Tools

Functional: Printed & tested.


Simple scissors
-----------------
[Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:638602)|[FreeCAD source](./simple-scissors.fcstd)|[STL](./export/simple-scissors-test-5.stl)

![Picture of assembled scissors](./doc/scissors-rev5.jpg)


Works OK for medium- and thick paper, as well as cardboard.
Thin paper and other soft/flexible material does not work well when attempting to use shearing motion, but the blades are so sharp that they are easily cut just by slicing though.
Also succesfully tested cutting small electronics wires, small plastic pieces, including 2.85 mm PLA filament.

Vitamins needed:

* 2x 18 mm snap-off blades
* 1x M5 locknut
* 1x M5 bolt 16mm+
* 2x M5 washers

Print 2 pieces of the simple-scissors STL (approx 15-20 mins per piece).
Snap off 3 pieces of each blade before inserting into slot in printed part.

Possible improvements:

* Angle the blades slightly towards eachother
* Devise mechanism to make clamping it down cause blades to tighten towards eachother.


Small blade shears
-------------------

[Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:640411)|[FreeCAD source](./blade-shears.fcstd)|[STL](./export/blade-shears-4.stl)

![Picture of assembled blade shears](./doc/blade-shears.jpg)

Vitamins needed

* 1x 18 mm snap-off blade, split in two

Instructions:

* Print, using 50% infill
* Cut open the support in interior wall using a blade
* Press-fit the blades

Possible improvements:

* Angle the blades slightly torwards eachother
* Oversize the Z-axis of blade socket a little bit to ease mounting
* Add some holes for adding set-screws for fitting blades
* Have a little gap in the support to guide cutting

Reference
=========

Blades
------

Snap-off blades are flexible, sharp and affordable blades
which are very easy to come by. 

The most common variants are:

* 18 mm height, 10 mm section, 60 deg angle, 100 mm total length. 
* 9 mm height, 5 mm section, 60 deg angle, 80 mm total length.

Thickness is usually 0.4 - 0.5 mm.

Stories
============

When the OpenROV people did a workshop in a rural (but technologically developed) area,
they had brought all the materials and tools needed - apart from scissors.
Sourcing the scissors took several hours and hampered the workshop.
