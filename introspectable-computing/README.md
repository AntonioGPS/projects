# Introspectable programming

Researching making programs and systems that are *introspectable*.
That is, *programs that know what they are* and *how they work*,
and provide facilities for *viewing*, *extracting* and *querying* this
information.

And with these capabilities in place, how can we represent problems & solutions
in a better way. Can we make programs more *understandable*, faster to get to a useful level, and more robust?
Can we use these properties to make programming more widely applicable and accessible,
also as a tool outside software development?

Note that this is a broader use of the word 'introspection' compared to
typically in programming, which usually is limited to very primitive information, like types.

# Motivations

There are 3 primary motivations for this work. From most concrete to most speculative:

1. Increasing the ability of experienced programmers to reason about
non-trivial systems, and write more advanced and robust software.
2. Helping blur the lines between 'programmers' and 'non-programmers' (domain experts, interested users),
by making the system more inviting and self-describing.
3. Open up the possibility for self-governing systems and intelligent agents.
Where the entity using the introspection information is another program, instead of a human.


# Areas of research

Some of the areas I have done work in, or think could be fruitful to research.
Most are prototyped in JavaScript/CoffeeScript and can be run in webbrowser + Node.js,
but often having a component of C/C++ and low-level/hardware/electronics component too it.

In rough order of time spent / maturity.

Logic programming

- [miniKamren](http://minikanren.org/) is a embedded logic programming DSL, that for instance powers Clojure `core.logic`.
[veneer](https://github.com/tca/veneer) looks to be the only maintained JavaScript/browser version,
but [microScopeKamren](https://github.com/asolove/microScopeKanren) has the explicit focus "inspecting logic programs as they run".

Research

- [metamodels for structured interaction with machine intelligence](http://ppig.org/sites/default/files/2015-PPIG-26th-Sarkar-2.pdf).
Many good references to work on interactive machine learning, and end-user programming/debugging. No sure I buy premise of 'goal being ill-defined'.

Established ideas

- [Python docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring), `doc()` and `help()` functions

Interactive-notebook programming

- Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha very established in this area.
- Jupyter. For Python primarily, but supports wide-range of alternate 'kernels' in different languages.
Kernel communicates with frontend over a ZeroMQ+JSON based message protocol.
Can visualize the outputs of code blocks, using a `display` protocol.
`interact` decorator allows to get interactive widgets for a function.
`nbviewer` tool can render to static HTML, and a service on-demand render a notebook from URL. Output is included.
`Bokeh` visualization embeds JavaScript, so plots can be interactive in a rendered notebook.
Lots of uptake in data science, data journalism - focusing on reproducability and 'interactive', 'data-driven' stories.
The interactive visualization widgets are accessible as an NPM module, [jupyter-js-widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets)

Ideas applicable to standard programming

- Use a collection to define related functions, for instance implementation for each message type in a protocol. 
Can then introspect the collection to check completeness and common properties/invariants, or generate documentation.

Recent development
