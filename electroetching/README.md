# Electroetching

Electroetching is a technique for etching practically any metal,
which is safe and can be done with common househould equipment.

See also planned [workshop](./workshop.md).

## Uses

TODO: link pictures here

* Making magnetic parts for [motors](../brushless). 
* Making decorations or jewelry. Ex: gothic style black+stainless
* Printing plates
* Marking objects, informational.
* Branding objects
* Graffiti/streetart??? (not seen yet)

## Mask making

Key practical challenge.

Ways of making pattern

* Hand- Scraped or cut
* Photolitography
* Toner transfer
* Laser ablation
* Vinylcutter

Traditionally for a "hard ground" a mix of beeswax and bitumen/asphaltum (a kind of tar) was used.

[Vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRTfDfH6mrs) recommends using floor wax, with a bit of pigment added to see the color.
[Blogpost](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=2575) says that vaseline works great, and wax from candle works OK.

Very important to degrease metal plate first, to ensure the ground sticks. Using a solvent like acetone etc.
Using a bit of abrasive to roughen the surface up can improve it sticking further. For instance steel whool.

Several references online to nail-polish working well. Dries quickly, easily available in small amounts.

## Safety

# Electroforming

## Conductive ink/paint

Useful as a base when electroplating/electroforming non-conductive materials.
Commonly used is carbon-based inks

* [DIY Conductive Paint for Electroforming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scEipkTWxxs)
Using plain carbon powder from Amazon or dry lubricant from store. Mixed by hand with water and acrylic paint.
* [How To Make A Conductive Ink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SHPGGQ34).
Using gum arabic dissolved in water using heat as binder, then mixing in carbon.
Based on Bare Conductive recipie, but without glyserol plasticier/humidifier.
Using graphite, getting conductivity results about 4x better than Bare Conductive.

Using thinner from water/isoproponal, soap, filtering out big particles using screenprinting film.
