* Printing plates
* Marking objects, informational.
* Branding objects
* Graffiti/streetart??? (not seen yet)

## Mask making

Key practical challenge.

* Hand-cut. For instance in wax
* Phototransfer
* Lasercutter

## Safety


## Conductive ink/paint

Useful as a base when electroplating/electroforming non-conductive materials.
Commonly used is carbon-based inks

* [DIY Conductive Paint for Electroforming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scEipkTWxxs)
Using plain carbon powder from Amazon or dry lubricant from store. Mixed by hand with water and acrylic paint.
* [How To Make A Conductive Ink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SHPGGQ34).
Using gum arabic dissolved in water using heat as binder, then mixing in carbon.
Based on Bare Conductive recipie, but without glyserol plasticier/humidifier.
Using graphite, getting conductivity results about 4x better than Bare Conductive.

Using thinner from water/isoproponal, soap, filtering out big particles using screenprinting film.
